# rosalind-exercises

Here, I provide my solutions to Rosalind Exercises 1-21 in a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb). The txt files I used were provided by Rosalind during my own attempts, and will be different for each subsequent problem attempt.

To minimise hassle (and to use the code as-is), I recommend you store the txt files in a folder called "exercises", in the same folder as the .ipynb file.

I used a webscraper (BeautifulSoup) for Exercise 16.
